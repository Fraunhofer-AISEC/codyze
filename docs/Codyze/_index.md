  Codyze is a static analysis tool to support developers in verifying compliance to security requirements
---

{{% pageinfo %}}
Codyze is currently being redesigned.
The legacy version of Codyze, in the following called __Codyze v2__, will be maintained for the foreseeable future.
Differences between the redesigned version, called __Codyze v3__, and __Codyze v2__ will be explicitly stated in this documentation.

Security is hard and implementing it correctly is even harder. Luckily, there are well-established and battle-proven libraries available that do the heavy lifting of security functions such as authentication, logging or encryption. But even when using these libraries in application code, developers run the risk of making subtle errors which may undermine the security of their application. This is where {{< param product >}} helps. By integrating it into an IDE or CI pipeline, developers can analyse their source code while programming and check if they are using libraries in a correct or in an insecure way.

## How does it work?

In contrast to many other static analysis tools, Codyze directly analyzes the source code and does not require a compiler tool-chain. It can thus even analyse incomplete source code and tolerate small syntax errors.

Codyze is based on a "Code Property Graph", which represents the source code as a graph and adds semantic information to support the analysis. This representation can be used in two ways:

1. as a fully automated tool, integrated into your CI or IDE
2. as a database that can be manually explored using a simple query language

## Why Codyze?

Codyze checks source code for the correct usage of libraries. It is an addition to generic static analysis tools such as Sonarqube, Frama-C, or the Checker Framework and specifically verifies that libraries are used as originally intended by their developers. 

**Library developers** write rules for their library in a simple domain specific language, called *MARK*.

**Developers** verify their code against rules of modelled libraries using Codyze - either as an IDE-plugin or as a CI module.

**Integrators** of open source components may want to verify these components using the automated analyis of Codyze or by manually search the code for critical patterns.
