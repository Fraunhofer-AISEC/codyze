Codyze provides an inbuilt domain specific language, __Coko__, which can be used to define policies for Codyze.

## Structure of Policies

Coko policies can be split into two parts:

* Modelling the API through classes and functions.
* Writing rules that describe the expected usage of the modelled API.

When modeling a library, you will typically start by describing its classes or functions and then write rules.

## Structure of Coko

Coko is defined as a custom Kotlin scripting language, so its syntax is the same as Kotlin.
For writing Coko policies you will need to know how to create classes, interfaces and functions in Kotlin.
Please refer to the [Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html) for an overview.

Syntax highlighting and code completion are available for Coko in any IDE that provides these for Kotlin.
