  Codyze offers a multitude of configurations to customize the analysis to your liking.

Codyze can be configured through command line options when starting codyze.

The most important options are
* the execution modes (`-c`. `-l` and `-t`)
* the source path (`-s <sourcepath>`)
* the path to the MARK files (`-m <markpath>`)

Another way for configuring Codyze is through a YAML configuration file. Use `--config` to specify the path to the file.

For more information about the configuration file and a complete list of all configurations, please refer to our [wiki page](https://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/codyze/wiki/Configuring-Codyze)
