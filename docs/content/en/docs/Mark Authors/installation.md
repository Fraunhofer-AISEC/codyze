  Setting up the MARK authoring environment with Eclipse XText
---

MARK is a simple domain specific language (DSL) that can be written in any text editor. We recommend however using the MARK Eclipse plugin which brings syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and some other benefits that will support you in writing MARK rules.


## Installing the MARK Eclipse Plugin

* In Eclipse, click on `Help`->`Install new software`
* Add the update site: `https://update.breakpoint-security.de`
* Install (TODO: Name of product in eclipse update site)
