<h2>Funding and Collaboration</h2>
<p>{{ .Site.Title }} is a non-profit project under a commercial-friendly open source license. We are happy to either improve and extend {{ .Site.Title }} in funded research projects or build a tailored version for your enterprise.

<h4>Commercial development</h4>
We offer tailoring and integration of Codyze into your CI pipeline or audit processes. This includes development of rule sets for specific software platforms (Java EE, Spring, Android, Boost, etc.), development of interfaces to standard CI tools (Gitlab CI, Jenkins, Bamboo, Sonarqube, etc.), and development of additional analyses tailored to your needs. The results will not be public and remain solely at your disposal.
<p></p>
<h4>Research collaboration</h4>
We regularly participate in publicly funded research projects at state, nation, and EU level. If you are interested in pushing the boundaries in static code analysis with us, we are happy to explore funding opportunities together with you.
